# Marvin Chatbot Project

The **Marvin Chatbot Project** is a Python application that exemplifies AI character personification using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model. This project centers around Marvin, an AI chatbot that engages users in lifelike conversations, effectively portraying a distinct character.

## Introduction

Personification, the attribution of human traits to non-human entities, is artfully employed in the Marvin Chatbot Project. Marvin, the digital character brought to life by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, engages users with responses akin to human interaction, illustrating the remarkable potential of AI personification.
